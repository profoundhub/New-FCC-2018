The `h2` element you enter will create an `h2` element on the website.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. `h1` elements are often used for main headings, while `h2` elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6` elements to indicate different and new sections.

Add an `h2` tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" `h1` element.
