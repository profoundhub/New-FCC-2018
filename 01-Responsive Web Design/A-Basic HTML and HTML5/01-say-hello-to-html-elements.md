# Say Hello to HTML Elements 

Welcome to Free Code Camp's first coding challenge.

You can edit code in your text editor, which we've embedded into this web page.

Do you see the code in your text editor that says `<h1>Hello</h1>`? That's an HTML element.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

`<h1>`

Closing tags look like this:

`</h1>`

Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

Each challenge has tests that you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. Once you get all tests passing, you can advance to the next challenge.

To pass the test on this challenge, change your `h1` element's text to say "Hello World" instead of "Hello". Then click the "Run tests" button.
