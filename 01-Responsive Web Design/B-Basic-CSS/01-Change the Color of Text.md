# Basic CSS: Change the Color of Text

Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.

The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

`<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>`

Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .

## Task

Change your h2 element's style so that its text color is red.

## Tests: 

* Your h2 element should be red.
* Your style declaration should end with a ; .
