# ES6: Explore Problems with the var Keyword

One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.

    var camper = 'James';
    var camper = 'David';
    console.log(camper);
    // logs 'David'

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidently overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite. Because this behaviour does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

Another problem with the `var` keyword is that it is hoisted to the top of your code when it compiles. This means that you can use a variable before you declare it.

    console.log(camper);
    var camper = 'David';
    // logs undefined

The code runs in the following order:

1. The variable `camper` is declared as undefined.
2. The value of `camper` is logged.
3. David is assigned to `camper`.

This code will run without an error.

A new keyword called `let` was introduced in ES6 to solve the problems with the `var` keyword. With the `let` keyword, all the examples we just saw will cause an error to appear. We can no longer overwrite variables or use a variable before we declare it. Some modern browsers require you to add `"use strict"`; to the top of your code before you can use the new features of ES6.

Let's try using the `let` keyword.

## Task: 

Fix the code so that it only uses the let keyword and makes the errors go away.

## Test:

* `redNosedReindeer` should be Rudolph.
* `favorite` should return Santa's favorite reindeer.
